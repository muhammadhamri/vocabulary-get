            Once upon a time, in a forest, there lived a clever fox. One day, the fox saw a crow on a tree branch with a piece of cheese in its beak.
            
            The fox wanted the cheese, so he called out, "Dear Crow, your feathers are so beautiful! I've heard you have a wonderful voice. Would you sing for me?"
            
            Flattered, the crow opened its beak to sing, and the cheese fell to the ground. The fox quickly ate the cheese.
            
            Realizing it had been tricked, the crow learned a valuable lesson: never trust a flatterer.
            
            The fox walked away, pleased with his cleverness, while the crow flew away, wiser from the experience.
