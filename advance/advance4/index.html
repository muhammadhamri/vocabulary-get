          Elephants are the largest land animals, recognized for their large ears, long trunks, and thick, gray skin. There are two species: African and Asian elephants.

          <!-- Physical Characteristics: -->
          
          African elephants, larger with big ears, can weigh up to 6,000 kilograms and stand 3.3 meters tall. Asian elephants are smaller, weighing up to 5,500 kilograms and standing about 2.7 meters tall, with smaller ears.
          
          <!-- Habitat: -->
          
          African elephants live in sub-Saharan Africa, while Asian elephants are found in India and Southeast Asia. They inhabit various environments, including savannas and forests.
          
          <!-- Diet: -->
          
          Elephants are herbivores, eating grasses, leaves, fruits, and bark. An adult consumes up to 300 kilograms of food and 100 liters of water daily.
          
          <!-- Behavior: -->
          
          Elephants are intelligent and social, living in herds led by a matriarch. They communicate with various sounds, from trumpets to low-frequency rumbles.
          
          <!-- Conservation Status: -->
          
          Elephants are threatened by habitat loss and poaching for ivory. Conservation efforts aim to protect these animals and their environments.
